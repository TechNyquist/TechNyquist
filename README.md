## Goals
I love videogames, but making one is expensive. So I'm developing libraries and tools which might help people.

I have many plots for videogames, but they live there waiting for the dream to come true.

## How to contribute
You can (and should) create issues on what goes wrong, fork projects and provide PullRequests and hints.

Join, comment, share your appreciation (or criticism), make me feel alive.

## How to support
If you find useful what I do, you may consider supporting the development becoming a Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/technyquist .

That'd be very very much appreciated. <3
